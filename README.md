<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The present project is aimed to predict the salaries of Employees based on their years of experience using Linear regression in Python.

Employee Salary Predictor is a project that can be used to assist Human Resource Managers in predicting the salaries of employees and minimize errors. 

Simple regression is used in this project. A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y. 
a is the constant term or the y intercept. It is the value of the dependent variable when x = 0.
b is the coefficient of the independent variable. It is also known as the slope and gives the rate of change of the dependent variable.


Why is it linear regression? let’s visualize our data set with a scatterplot!
